<h2>🔍 How It Works</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>💬 User Input:</strong> The user submits a legal question or prompt through a simple interface.</li>
  <li><strong>📚 Semantic Search:</strong> The prompt is embedded and used to query a vector database containing semantic representations (embeddings) of a legal book.</li>
  <li><strong>📖 Contextual Retrieval:</strong> Relevant sections of the legal text are retrieved based on semantic similarity to the user's query.</li>
  <li><strong>🧠 AI-Powered Response:</strong> The original query and retrieved context are passed to <code>GPT-Neo 1.3B</code>, which generates a response grounded in legal context.</li>
</ol>
